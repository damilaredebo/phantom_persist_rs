## Overview
The **Phantom Persistence** technique is a sophisticated method used in cybersecurity. This repository offers a Rust implementation of the technique, as documented in the article found [here](https://blog.phantomsec.tools/phantom-persistence). The goal is to provide a clear, efficient, and practical way to understand and apply this method.

## Installation
To get started, you need to clone the repository. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damilaredebo/phantom_persist_rs.git
cd phantom_persist_rs
```

Next, ensure you have Rust installed. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is set up, you can build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
After building the project, you can run it directly from the command line. Navigate to the target directory:

```bash
cd target/release
```

Then execute the binary:

```bash
./phantom_persist_rs
```

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation included in the repository.

## Features
- **Lightweight**: The implementation is designed to be minimal and efficient.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various operating systems without significant modifications.
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and documentation for easy understanding.
- **Customizable**: Users can modify the code to fit specific needs.

## Technical Details
This implementation uses core Rust features to achieve phantom persistence. It relies on several libraries to enhance functionality, including:

- **Tokio**: For asynchronous programming.
- **Serde**: For data serialization and deserialization.
- **Clap**: For command-line argument parsing.

### Code Structure
The repository contains the following main components:

- **src/**: Contains the main Rust source files.
- **Cargo.toml**: The manifest file for Rust's package manager.
- **README.md**: This file.

### Example Code Snippet
Here is a brief example of how the core functionality is structured:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Initialize the phantom persistence
    let persistence = PhantomPersistence::new();
    
    // Execute the persistence method
    persistence.execute();
}
```

This snippet demonstrates the initialization and execution of the phantom persistence method.
